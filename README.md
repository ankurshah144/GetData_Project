Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project
==========================================

This repo was created to upload "R" code and supporting documents torwards the Course Project for Coursera course Getting and Cleaning Data.

It contains the following files:

1. run_analysis.R

2. GetAndCleanDataProject.txt

3. Activity Codebook.pdf


### run_analysis.R
This file contains the R code that performs the following transformations on [Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphone](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones) data, downloaded from [here](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip).

Detailed comments have been included in the code. However, here's a high-level overview of what it does:

- Download and unzip files

- Combine training and test data

- Extracts only the mean and standard deviation values for each measurement

- Updates data with descriptive activity names

- Updates data with meaningful column names for each measurement

- Creates a separate, independent tidy data set that contains averages of each measurement, grouped by Subject and Activity

### GetAndCleanDataProject.txt
This file contains the tidy data set generated by run_analysis.R

### Activity Codebook.pdf
This codebook describes each column of the tidy data present in GetAndCleanDataProject.txt.
